The idea of this website was suggested by [my father](http://www.starwars.com/databank/darth-vader).
These static pages have been created with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator, by modifying its basic default
layout (not willing to disregard Hyde, [here](hyde.html) it is if you want to take a look).

The web server providing the website is being run on a [MirageOS](http://www.openmirage.org/)-based
virtual machine, powered by [Xen](http://www.xenproject.org/) and hosted on an [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
t2.micro instance. If you want to re-create this setup, please have a look at the MirageOS [documentation pages](http://www.openmirage.org/docs/),
or at [Mindy Preston's blog](http://somerandomidiot.com/).
